# Arrays and Array Cardio Exercise

What is an Array? Array is used for holding a list of items where order matters. Each thing inside array is called item and its position is called INDEX. Each item inside an array can be anything, any type (string, boolean, another array...)

:point_right: Main difference between arrays and object is that arrays has no keys. Keys in arrays are indexes.

:bulb: At the end of the day, array is an object. *type of* (const) *names* is "object". 

Array.isArray(names) is for checking if something is actually array 

Arrays are zero based! Counts from 0 - 

Difference between *mutable* and *immutable* methods

Slice & splice method. The *splice()* method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place while the *slice()* method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from begin to end (end not included) where begin and end represent the index of items in that array. The original array will not be modified.
